### **ðŸ§  STEP 2: Context7 Research Phase**

**CTO Agent Action**: Conducting autonomous research using Context7 MCP...

**Research Findings:**
- **Casino Bonus Patterns**: Analyzed leading casino comparison implementations
- **Performance Standards**: Identified sub-200ms API requirements and optimization techniques
- **Security Best Practices**: Documented XSS prevention and input validation patterns
- **Mobile Optimization**: Research responsive design patterns for casino interfaces
- **SEO Strategies**: Competitive analysis for bonus-related keyword optimization

**Architecture Decisions:**
- PHP 8.1+ with modern features (readonly properties, enums)
- Vue.js 3 Composition API with TypeScript
- PostgreSQL for relational bonus data
- Redis for caching and performance optimization
- Nginx with security headers and SSL termination

### **ðŸ”„ STEP 3: Sequential Thinking Analysis**

**CTO Agent Action**: Applying systematic thinking to break down implementation...

**Systematic Analysis:**
1. **Requirement Dependencies**: Identified critical path and agent coordination needs
2. **Risk Assessment**: Documented potential bottlenecks and mitigation strategies
3. **Quality Gates**: Defined mandatory checkpoints for deployment readiness
4. **Performance Targets**: Established measurable success criteria
5. **Compliance Requirements**: Mapped GDPR and security obligations

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Phase 1: Foundation (Backend API + Security)
- Phase 2: Frontend Development (Vue.js + UX)
- Phase 3: Testing & Validation (Playwright + Security)
- Phase 4: Optimization (Performance + SEO)
- Phase 5: Deployment (Infrastructure + Monitoring)
