## **CTO Agent Test Protocol**

### **Phase 1: Autonomous Todo Planning**
**Expected Behavior**: CTO agent should automatically:
1. Use `manage_todo_list` to create comprehensive todo breakdown
2. Analyze PRD requirements and create specific actionable items
3. Set priorities and dependencies for each todo
4. Define clear acceptance criteria

### **Phase 2: Context7 Research**
**Expected Behavior**: CTO agent should:
1. Research casino bonus comparison best practices
2. Analyze similar implementations and patterns
3. Gather performance optimization techniques
4. Document findings and recommendations

### **Phase 3: Sequential Thinking Analysis**
**Expected Behavior**: CTO agent should:
1. Apply systematic thinking to break down complex decisions
2. Plan implementation strategy with logical progression
3. Document reasoning for architectural decisions
4. Create step-by-step execution plan

### **Phase 4: Multi-Agent Orchestration**
**Expected Behavior**: CTO agent should autonomously coordinate:

| Agent | Assigned Tasks | Expected Deliverables |
|-------|----------------|----------------------|
| **Senior PHP Architect** | Backend API development | Bonus comparison API endpoints |
| **Vue Component Specialist** | Frontend interface | Responsive bonus comparison table |
| **Playwright Testing Specialist** | E2E testing | Comprehensive test suite |
| **Security Auditor** | Security validation | Security scan and compliance report |
| **Performance Optimizer** | Performance optimization | Core Web Vitals compliance |
| **DevOps Infrastructure** | Deployment setup | Blue-green deployment pipeline |
| **Data Analytics Engineer** | Analytics implementation | User tracking and metrics |
| **UX Design Specialist** | User experience | Mobile-optimized design |
| **SEO Content Strategist** | SEO optimization | Keyword optimization and content |
| **Compliance Legal Officer** | GDPR compliance | Privacy compliance validation |
| **PRD & Context Memory Officer** | Specification enforcement | Context and requirement tracking |

### **Phase 5: Quality Assurance**
**Expected Behavior**: CTO agent should:
1. Monitor all agent progress and deliverables
2. Enforce mandatory Playwright testing
3. Validate security and compliance requirements
4. Ensure performance targets are met
5. Coordinate final integration and deployment
