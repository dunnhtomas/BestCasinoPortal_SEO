# ðŸŽ° MCP Memory Keeper Integration Guide
## Casino Portal Project - Long Context Management

> **Successfully Integrated!** âœ… All 12 integration tests passing

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

The MCP Memory Keeper is now fully integrated with our casino portal project and ready for use. This provides persistent context management across development sessions, preventing context loss during long coding sessions.

### Available Commands

```bash
# Initialize (already done)
npm run memory:init

# Save context entries
npm run memory:save <key> <value> [category] [priority]

# Create checkpoints
npm run memory:checkpoint <name> [description]

# Generate project summaries
npm run memory:summary

# Test connection
npm run memory:test
```

## ðŸ“‹ Usage Examples

### Save Progress
```bash
npm run memory:save "feature_complete" "Casino card component fully implemented with tests" "progress" "high"
```

### Save Architectural Decisions
```bash
npm run memory:save "vue_composition_api" "Using Vue.js 3 Composition API for better TypeScript integration" "architecture" "critical"
```

### Save Security Findings
```bash
npm run memory:save "security_headers" "Implemented CSP, HSTS, and X-Frame-Options headers" "security" "high"
```

### Save Performance Optimizations
```bash
npm run memory:save "core_web_vitals" "Achieved LCP < 2.5s and FID < 100ms targets" "performance" "high"
```

### Create Checkpoint Before Major Changes
```bash
npm run memory:checkpoint "before-refactor" "Stable state before major authentication refactor"
```

### Generate Current Status
```bash
npm run memory:summary
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Categories and Priorities

### Categories
- `architecture` - Design decisions and patterns
- `progress` - Development milestones and completions
- `decisions` - Important project decisions
- `testing` - Test results and quality metrics
- `security` - Security implementations and findings
- `performance` - Performance optimizations and metrics
- `agent-reports` - Multi-agent system outputs

### Priorities
- `critical` - Mission-critical information
- `high` - Important progress and decisions
- `normal` - Regular progress updates
- `low` - Nice-to-have information

## ðŸ”§ Configuration

The MCP Memory Keeper is configured in `.mcp/config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memory-keeper": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-memory-keeper"],
      "env": {
        "DATA_DIR": "./memory-data",
        "MCP_MEMORY_STORAGE_BACKEND": "sqlite_vec",
        "MCP_MEMORY_SQLITE_PATH": "./memory-data/casino-portal-memory.db",
        "MCP_MEMORY_BACKUPS_PATH": "./memory-data/backups",
        "PROJECT_NAME": "BestCasinoPortal_SEO",
        "CHANNEL": "casino-portal-unified"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## ðŸ“‚ Data Storage

Memory data is stored in the `memory-data/` directory:

```
memory-data/
â”œâ”€â”€ casino-portal-context.json     # Project initialization context
â”œâ”€â”€ context-history.json           # All saved context entries
â”œâ”€â”€ project-summary.json          # Latest project summary
â””â”€â”€ backups/                       # Checkpoint backups
    â””â”€â”€ checkpoint-*.json
```

## ðŸ¤– Integration with Multi-Agent System

The memory keeper integrates seamlessly with our multi-agent architecture:

### Agent Reports Integration
```bash
# Memory keeper automatically tracks agent reports
npm run memory:save "php_agent_complete" "Senior PHP Architect completed API design" "agent-reports" "high"
```

### Agent Coordination
```bash
# Save coordination decisions
npm run memory:save "agent_coordination" "Vue specialist to handle frontend, PHP architect for backend API" "decisions" "critical"
```

## ðŸ”„ Session Management

### Start New Session
1. Run `npm run memory:summary` to see current state
2. Create checkpoint: `npm run memory:checkpoint "session-start" "Starting new development session"`
3. Continue with context preserved

### End Session
1. Save final progress: `npm run memory:save "session_end" "Completed XYZ features" "progress" "normal"`
2. Create checkpoint: `npm run memory:checkpoint "session-end" "End of productive session"`
3. Generate summary: `npm run memory:summary`

### Context Recovery
If context is lost or conversation is reset:
1. Run `npm run memory:summary` to see project overview
2. Check latest checkpoints in `memory-data/backups/`
3. Review context history in `memory-data/context-history.json`

## ðŸ§ª Testing and Validation

Run the integration tests to verify everything is working:

```bash
npx playwright test tests/mcp-memory-keeper-integration.spec.js --reporter=line
```

**Current Status:** âœ… All 12 tests passing

## ðŸ“Š Current Project State

Based on the latest summary:

- **Project**: BestCasinoPortal_SEO
- **Channel**: casino-portal-unified
- **Total Context Entries**: 4
- **Active Agents**: 0 (reports available)
- **Key Files**: 2 tracked

### Recent Progress
- MCP Memory Keeper integration completed successfully
- All integration tests passing
- Persistent context management active

### Next Steps
1. Continue development with MCP Memory Keeper active
2. Ensure all agent reports are up to date
3. Run comprehensive testing before deployment
4. Monitor performance and security metrics

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### Memory Keeper Not Working
```bash
# Test connection
npm run memory:test

# Reinitialize if needed
npm run memory:init
```

### Context Not Persisting
1. Check `.mcp/config.json` configuration
2. Verify `memory-data/` directory exists
3. Check write permissions
4. Run `npm run memory:test`

### Performance Issues
- Context history is stored locally for fast access
- Checkpoints are created as needed
- Old backups can be cleaned up manually

## ðŸŽ¯ Best Practices

1. **Regular Checkpoints**: Create checkpoints before major changes
2. **Meaningful Keys**: Use descriptive keys for context entries
3. **Proper Categories**: Use appropriate categories for better organization
4. **Priority Classification**: Mark critical decisions as high/critical priority
5. **Session Summaries**: Generate summaries at the end of each session

## ðŸ”® Advanced Features

### Custom Context Queries
The memory keeper supports advanced queries through the stored JSON files:

```javascript
// Example: Find all security-related entries
const history = require('./memory-data/context-history.json');
const securityEntries = history.filter(entry => entry.category === 'security');
```

### Integration with Claude Commands
Use the memory keeper with Claude commands:

```
@memory-keeper Please save this architectural decision about using PostgreSQL for our casino portal project.
```
